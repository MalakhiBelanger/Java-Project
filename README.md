_- By Malakhi Lemieux-Belanger and Elijah Harnadek_

## What the software manages  
This software helps esports team managers view 
and edit data associated with their teams players.
Each manager has login info that ties them to their
respective team that they manage.  
## Different utility  
This software doubles as a player overview if the user
signing in is a player. The software displays the respective
users stats and data in the games that they play, and can sign up
or change games they participate in (Notifies manager first
for confirmation).
